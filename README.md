# Data Engineering Playground
![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

A collection of learning resources and examples from my **Data Engineering journey**.  
This repo will gradually include Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, small projects, and utilities — all focused on topics like Python, Pandas, NumPy, SQL, visualization, and more.

## Structure
- **[`pandas-playground`](./pandas-playground/)** → Pandas basics: join, merge, concat, groupby, pivot tables.
- **`python-playground/`** → Python fundamentals and utilities.
- **`numpy-playground/`** → NumPy arrays and operations.
- **`visualization-playground/`** → Matplotlib, Seaborn, and data visualization.
- **`sql-playground/`** → SQL queries, joins, and database basics.

## Getting Started
Clone the repo and explore any playground:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mfhs/data-engineering-playground.git
cd data-engineering-playground
```

Run notebooks with Jupyter or scripts directly with Python.

Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed.  
You can check your version with:

    python --version

Install required libraries:

    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
